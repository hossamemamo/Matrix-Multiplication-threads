I experimented three methods
- nested loop to calculate the output Matrix
- calculate each output using a thread of it's own
- calculate each row in the output Matrix using a thread



## Installation

to try out different sizes of matrices change l,m,n in project.cpp


```
    int l=500, m=500, n=50;
```
C = A*B

A has l rows and m cols

B has m rows and n cols

C has l rows and n cols
